# MBet-Adera Authentication Fix: Final Recommendation

Based on the diagnostic results, we've identified that:
1. All users exist in the profiles table
2. Only test@mbet.com can successfully authenticate
3. Other users are receiving "Invalid login credentials" errors

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue is that auth.users entries don't match the profiles table correctly. The SQL script we've prepared needs to be run in the Supabase Dashboard to fix the authentication records.

## Fix Authentication: Step-by-Step

### 1. Run the SQL Script in Supabase Dashboard

This is the most important step. The SQL script will:
- Update existing auth.users records correctly
- Preserve foreign key relationships
- Set the proper roles for each user type
- Reset passwords to a known value (MBet@2023)
- Make test@mbet.com an admin user

Instructions:
1. Log into Supabase dashboard at https://app.supabase.com/
2. Select your MBet-Adera project
3. Navigate to the SQL Editor
4. Create a new query
5. Copy the entire content of `direct_user_fix_v2.sql` and paste it
6. Run the script
7. Look for the "USER FIX COMPLETE" message to confirm success

### 2. Reset Authentication Cache in the App

Run the reset script:
```bash
node reset-app-auth.js
```

This will clear any cached tokens and add auto-clearing code to your app.

### 3. Test Login with Different Users

Try logging in with any of these test accounts:
- test@mbet.com (admin)
- bereket@example.com (customer)
- driver3@example.com (driver) 
- staff2@mbet.com (staff)

All should use the password: `MBet@2023`

## If Problems Persist

1. Run the diagnostic tools:
```bash
node simple-auth-check.js
```

2. Check if the SQL script executed successfully:
   - Look for any errors in the Supabase SQL editor
   - Verify users are visible in the Supabase Authentication UI

3. Check your app's connection to Supabase:
   - Verify your SUPABASE_URL is correct
   - Check for any network issues

4. As a last resort, manually update user records in the Supabase Authentication UI:
   - Reset passwords
   - Confirm emails
   - Set correct metadata with roles

## Next Steps After Fix

1. Implement a password reset feature
2. Consider updating role management for better security
3. Add proper error handling for authentication issues
4. Set up monitoring to catch similar issues early
