# MBet-Adera Database Schema Enhancements

## Overview
This document summarizes the comprehensive database schema enhancements made to the MBet-Adera delivery system. These enhancements address the initial error "ERROR: 42703: column 'user_id' does not exist" and provide additional functionality for a robust delivery management system.

## Core Components Enhanced

### 1. User Retention View Fix
The user retention view was incorrectly using "user_id" instead of "sender_id". This was fixed in:
- `fix_user_retention_view.sql` - Full fix with proper error handling
- `simplified_user_retention_fix.sql` - Simplified version avoiding syntax errors

### 2. Payment Gateway Integration
Implemented in `01_payment_gateway_integration.sql`:
- Support for multiple payment methods (YenePay, Chapa, TeleBirr, wallet, cash)
- Transaction history and tracking
- Gateway configuration management

### 3. Dynamic Pricing System
Implemented in `02_pricing_system.sql`:
- Flexible pricing rules based on distance, weight, and package size
- Pricing categories for different service tiers
- Discount codes and promotions
- Price calculation history for auditing

### 4. Delivery Personnel & Tracking
Implemented in `tracking_and_personnel_enhancement.sql`:
- Personnel management (drivers, couriers)
- Real-time location tracking
- Route optimization
- Delivery assignments
- Detailed parcel status history

### 5. User Roles & Permissions
Implemented in `user_roles_enhancement.sql`:
- Granular role-based access control
- Extended user profiles
- User verification system
- Activity logging

### 6. Analytics & Reporting
Implemented in `analytics_and_reporting_enhancement.sql`:
- System-wide performance metrics
- Personnel performance tracking
- Materialized views for fast reporting
- Scheduled jobs for data refreshing

## Implementation Features

### Error Handling
- Idempotent scripts with proper dependency checks
- Use of DO blocks to safely check for existence before modifications
- Graceful handling of missing dependencies

### Schema Structure
- Well-organized tables with appropriate relationships
- Comprehensive indexing for performance
- Detailed documentation using COMMENT statements
- Separation of concerns across different modules

### Data Integrity
- Proper use of foreign keys for referential integrity
- Default values for consistency
- Timestamp tracking for auditing
- JSON/JSONB for flexible data structures

## Applied Fixes

### User Retention View Fix
```sql
-- Changed from:
SELECT sender_id, -- Changed from user_id to sender_id

-- To properly handle parcels table structure where sender_id is the correct column
```

### Database Enhancement Flow
1. Extension creation (uuid-ossp, postgis)
2. Core tables creation
3. Relational tables with proper dependencies
4. Indexing for performance
5. Documentation via comments
6. Data initialization with default values

This schema provides a solid foundation for the MBet-Adera delivery system with integrated payment processing, dynamic pricing, personnel management, and analytics capabilities.
