# MBet-Adera App Fixes

This document outlines the fixes that have been made to address various issues in the MBet-Adera delivery system app.

## Issues Fixed

1. **Missing Image Assets**
   - Replaced missing empty-deliveries.png with MaterialIcons component
   - Removed unnecessary Image imports to prevent future errors

2. **Navigation Issues**
   - Added cross-platform navigation support for Profile route
   - Created fallbacks for different navigation patterns (Expo Router & React Navigation)

3. **Database Table/View Missing**
   - Added SQL script to create the parcels_with_addresses view
   - Implemented fallback in app code to use the parcels table when the view is missing

4. **Reduced Console Logging**
   - Modified supabase.ts to filter out verbose GoTrueClient logs
   - Reduced error output to only show essential information

## How to Apply the Database Fix

To fix the missing parcels_with_addresses view, run the following SQL:

```bash
# Connect to your database
psql -U postgres -d your_database_name

# Or through Supabase if using their platform
supabase db execute < newDBschema/parcels_with_addresses_view.sql
```

## Additional Notes

- The app now gracefully handles missing database objects with fallbacks
- Navigation now works consistently across all platforms (web, iOS, Android)
- Improved error handling with better user experience when things go wrong
- Reduced console logging to focus on essential information only
