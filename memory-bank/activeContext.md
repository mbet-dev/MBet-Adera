    - Implemented a LanguageContext provider
    - Created a LanguageSelector component
14. Added language selection to the Profile screen:
    - Created a custom LanguageSettingsItem component that integrates with the Profile UI
    - Added the language selector to the Preferences section of the Profile screen
    - Updated the LanguageSelector component to support a compact mode for better integration
    - Ensured consistent styling with other preference items
15. Updated documentation:
    - Updated MULTILINGUAL_SUPPORT.md to reflect the new implementation
    - Added information about where users can change their language preference

## Next Steps
1. Complete Memory Bank documentation
2. Set up development environment
3. Configure Supabase connection
4. Implement basic authentication flow
5. Set up navigation structure
6. Create core UI components
7. Implement QR code generation and scanning
8. ~~Set up multilingual support system~~ ✓ COMPLETED
9. ~~Implement language selection during onboarding~~ ✓ COMPLETED
10. ~~Add language selection to settings~~ ✓ COMPLETED
11. Testing
12. Onboarding Integration
13. Content Translation
14. RTL Layout Adjustments
15. User Feedback

## Active Decisions
1. Using Expo for cross-platform development
2. Supabase as backend service
3. TypeScript for type safety
4. React Navigation for routing
5. React Native Paper for UI components
6. react-native-qrcode-svg for QR functionality
7. i18next for internationalization
8. Implemented RTL support foundation for future RTL languages
9. Storing language preference in AsyncStorage
10. Using onboarding screen for first app launch with language selection
11. Adding language selector in settings for changing language later
12. **Language Selection Placement**: We've decided to place language selection in the Profile screen under Preferences rather than in a standalone Settings screen. This is more intuitive as it categorizes language as a user preference and keeps it with other similar settings.
13. **Language Selection UX**: The language selector opens a modal with all available languages, showing both the language name in English and in its native script. This helps users identify their preferred language even if they accidentally select a language they don't understand.
14. **Initial Language Selection**: Users can select their preferred language during the onboarding process, and later change it in their Profile preferences if needed.
15. **RTL Support**: The app supports right-to-left languages, automatically adjusting the layout when an RTL language is selected.

## Current Considerations
1. Authentication flow implementation
2. Payment gateway integration
